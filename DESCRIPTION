Title: Partition of Variation variance component analysis method
Version: 0.1.2
Author: Paul Deen
Maintainer: Paul Deen <paulext@gmail.com>
Description: An implementation of the pov method as developped by
    dr. Thomas A Little <https://thomasalittleconsulting.com> in 1993 for the
    analysis of semiconductor data for hard drive manufacturing. POV is based
    on ANOVA and sequential sum of squares and is an exact method that explains
    all observed variation. It quantitates both the between and within factor
    variation effects and can quantitate the influence of both continuous and
    categorical factors.
